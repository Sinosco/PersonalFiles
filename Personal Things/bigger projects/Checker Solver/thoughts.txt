end of 6/10 | 4:30 long session
Accomplished:
 - Board can be visualized
 - Initialize a hashmap connected the possible moves of every piece
 - Method to move a piece

Things that need to get done:
 - Recursive method to figure out the best possible move
    - Figure out how to determine whether a move is good or not
    - implement depth system
 - Actual system to play checkers in the terminal
 - MovePiece method may not work as intended when taking multiple pieces in sequence


Hey shaikh from 6/16
I have no clue what any of this code does. Please write documentation so future future me can make sense of it 
hugs and kisses -shaikh
please do it properly and make it make sense and like fix code if necessary pleas pleas pleas epalse

 - Debug canTakePiece() since its static. By doing that figure out a better way to display customize board configs
 - Finish making the game actually playable even if it is glitchy
 

Hey shaikh from 6/16 its shaikh from 6/18
Worked on this for like an hour, didn't do much documentation though. Largely finished the whole gaming
loop but can't debug until we fix the initializePotentialMovesList method. Work on the possibleTakeMoves method
or whatever I decided to call it. It should only look for chain reaction takes. Not sure what else 
we have to do but hey we'll figure it out as we get there. 

hey its shaikh from 10/12/23
Yeah I need to add a year in these dates now. Why did shaikh from 6/18 never make documentionat I do NOT remember how 
any of this works. Now I gotta read through it all again and make sense of your code. Hope you made it easy.
Best wishes, Shaikh from 101223
